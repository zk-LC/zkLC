## Coordination 

## Org: ZKLC 

### Ownership 

The project is for profit. 
It is owned 100% by the contributors. 

There will be three stages to this project: 
1. Boostrap (no tokens) 
2. Private ownership (owners with condition based transferrable tokens)  
3. Public ownership  (Tokens traded publicly) 

current stage: bootstrap

Ownership percentages are proportional to attribution points. 

### Attribution

At all stages of the project, attribution points will be awarded on regular basis (monthly or bi-monthly). Attribution points are neutral data layer documenitng individual contributions and stored onchain. 

Attributin points will be used to determine the distribution of any funds allocated for contributors as compensation for work (salary) from revenue, grants or retroactive funding. 

Current Attribution guilds: 

- Problem solvers guild
- Technical researchers guild  
- Developers guild   
 
More guilds will be added as the project develops.


### Clarifications:

legal structure: No decision has been made yet to register a company or where it will be registered. Once the legal requirments of serving users become clear and understood, the decision to register the company and under what form will be decided by contributors. 

Outside Investment: The project will start in bootstrap phase with no outside investment until is necessary. Based on initial roadmap, the project can make progress with bootstrap. 

Salaries (compensation): If the project secures any grants in this period, it will be distributed proprtionally based on attribution points. 

Project Tokens: No tokens currently exist and no decision on shape or utility of tokens is made. This will be clear as we approach stage2 of the project.  


### Individual guild details: 

Problem Solving (the leadership guild): Fit for generalists, thinkers, team players, responsible and accountable people. 

Technical researchers guild: For protocol architects, explorers of new technologies..etc. 

Dev Guild: For people who like to solve problems by writing code.

For more details about contribution and attribution points in specific guilds see the contributors guide.
